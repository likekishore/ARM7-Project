## Temperature controlled DC Motar

In this project, temperature dissipated by a radiating body is measured. Which in turn contorols the speed of a DC Motar. This is a closed loop system, which provides feedback to maintain a proper speed.

### Components required

1. LPC2148 (ARM7 Microcontroller)
2. Temperature sensor (LM35 or Better)
3. DC Motar
4. Driver circuit
5. LCD Display
